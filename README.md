# Project UZ-E

UZ-E is the first version of a humanoid robot under development by the LSA lab team, started in January 2025. The mechanical design is based on the InMoov project, with several improvements in the robot body. In contrast to the base projeto, our version aims to deliver non-stationaly legs, along with improved joints, print settings, parts reworking, and a more robotic appearance (not *too much* human).

Regarding electric and computing parts, we are replacing the whole electric model, adding non-specific boards to the project. Instead, we provide generic boards that can be adjusted to fit several applications. Also, we replaced the ATMega based boards by Blackpills, which provide much more computing power. Finally, the robot centralized control system relies on a Raspberry PI computer.

As the project advances, we'll update this page with additional info. Here's a photo of the robot as of March 2025 (2 months work).
